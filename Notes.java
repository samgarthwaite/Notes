 * Chapter 1
 *	 CPU gets smaller constantly
 *	 Can  X / + -  remember = and move data
 *	 RAM is temp stored files that the CPU can use. CPU can only use things from the RAM, not hard drive
 *	 ^ requires electrizity, main
 *	 HardDrive is secondary storage. Often magnetic disks.

 *	 8 bits to a byte
 *	 Binary:
 *	 		Each Place value is  2 to a power
 *	 		Try 101101
 *	 		1 x 2^5 + 0 x 2^4 + 1 x 2^3 + 1 x 2^2 + 0 x 2^1 + 1 * 2^0

 * Chapter 2
 *	Src has one or more class
 *	If there are more than 1 class, only one can be public - we wont have this problem
 *	Class name + file must match
 *	Each Java class can be separated into parts 
 *	Example
 *
 *	// Simple Java Program <--- Comment 
 *	public class Simple <--- Class header
 *	
 *	{
 *		public static void main (Strings [] args) <--- Main method header
 *	
 *		{
 *
 *			System.out.print("simple program"); <--- java statement
 *	}
 *
 *		The Main Method:
 *			-where any program starts 
 *			-starts the program
 *		Java Statement:
 *			-ends in a semicolon 
 *									Keep in mind
 *										-Java is case sensitive
 *										-must be  in a .java
 *	System.out.print()
 *	System is a class:
 *		Out is a method:
 *			print is a command in out
